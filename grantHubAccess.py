    This function manages the assignment and updating of associate access to hubs within fleets based on the availability of fleets and hubs. It performs necessary updates and creations, and communicates the results to the user.

    Parameters:
    - env: The environment where the fleet organization operates.
    - orgId: The organization ID within the chosen environment.
    - hubsList: A list of hubs to which the associate should have access.
    - allFleets: A list of all fleets within the selected environment and organization.
    - associate: The associate whose access is being managed.
    - userName: The name of the user making the changes.

    This function performs the following logical steps:

    1. Retrieve the names and IDs of hubs from the provided hubsList.
    2. Search for a fleet that has the same hubs as the associate's access.
    3. If a fleet with the correct hubs already exists, update the associate's data with that fleet.
    4. If the associate already has a fleet, check if other associates use the same fleet.
        - If no other associate uses the same fleet, update the existing fleet with the new hubs.
        - If other associates use the same fleet, create a new fleet with the provided hubs.
    5. If the associate doesn't have a fleet, create a new fleet with the provided hubs and associate it with the associate.
