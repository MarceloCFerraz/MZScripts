# How the script works:
# - Get associate IDs from 'associates.txt,' with each new line representing a new associate ID. No need for special formatting.
# - Use multithreading to search for associate IDs and save them in the ASSOCIATES array when found.
# - Interactively ask each associate about their hub access needs, one hub at a time. Press Enter with a blank input to continue.
# - Check if associates need to keep their current hub access:
#   - If yes:
#     - Add new hubs to the associate's hub list.
#     - Look for a fleet that already contains these hubs.
#       - If a fleet is found, update the associate's data with the fleet ID.
#       - If none exists, check if other associates use the same fleet.
#         - If no one does, update the fleet.
#         - If others do, create a new fleet with old and new hubs.
#   - If no:
#     - Search for a fleet with the new hubs.
#       - If a fleet is found, update the associate's data with the fleet ID.
#       - If none is found, check if other associates use the same fleet.
#         - If no one does, update the fleet.
#         - If others do, create a new fleet with old and new hubs.
#
# Additionally, manage driver and sorter relocations as needed:
# - Determine the new hub.
# - Modify the associate's hubId and locationId.
# - Remove any references to the previous 'fleetId,' 'preferredVehicle,' and 'preferredRoute' before updating the associate's data."
